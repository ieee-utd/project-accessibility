## Installation

1. Download this branch from the github [frontend-admin branch](https://github.com/ieee-utd/project-accessibility/tree/frontend-admin)
2. From the terminal, change directory into this folder with the following command: `cd frontend`
3. Remaining steps to get it running are unknown

There is no README, package-lock.json, or package.json, so I have no idea how to run these files/this application. `npm install` and `yarn install` commands both seemed to fail.
