# Project Accessibility front-end
First iteration of front end design

## Installation

1. Download this branch from the github [frontend branch](https://github.com/ieee-utd/project-accessibility/tree/front-end)
2. Follow the README instructions found in `./frontend` or in `./Desk-Friend-UI-Prototype-master`

## Usage

The application in `./frontend` doesn't seem to work. The application in `./Desk-Friend-UI-Prototype-master` functions as it says in its README file.

## Added Functionality from Last Iteration
Added a functional/working front end user interface.

## Planned Functionality for Next Iteration

1. Add more functionality to the `./Desk-Friend-UI-Prototype-master` UI
2. Possibly retire/archive `./frontend`
3. Work on the backend
